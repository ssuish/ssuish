# Hey there! 👋 

Backend-focused software engineer with experience building data-driven systems, API backends, and cloud infrastructure.

I currently work on enterprise-grade integrations (Boomi, Javascript, SQL-driven workflows) for UKG Pro systems and build backend-heavy side projects, including game backends, persistence layers, and distributed systems using TypeScript, Python, C#, and AWS.

I optimize for correctness, maintainability, and pragmatic delivery over novelty.
